For information about building the DODS CDF source code, see the INSTALL
file.

This file provides basic information about the DODS CDF server and its
configuration. For more detailed information, see the Server Installation
Guide at http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/user/install-html/.

The information that follows is mostly up to date, but the Server Install
Guide is probably a better source of information for most users.

DODS data servers make it simple to provide others with direct,
over-the-network, access to your data. There is no need to reformat
your data so that a new system can read it. Instead DODS uses the http server
along with a dispatch script and a set of three server programs (Data
Attribute Server, Data Structure Server, and Data Server) to make your
existing data files available to anyone who has access to a program rebuilt
with DODS components.

cdf-dods is a server implementation of The National Space Science Data
Center's CDF (Common Data Format), based on the Distributed Oceanographic 
Data System (DODS). The software contains data servers that can be used
along with any DODS client program to process data served by the cdf-dods
server.

The server can only read row major cdf files. It converts all variables into
z-variables for processing (easier than doing both z and r variables.) It
can read all CDF data types, representing EPOCH as a Float64. The data in
the data file is read then served using the appropriate DODS data type.

In short, all the data and attributes are processed. The data is reformatted
to the Dods data model and served. The user can refer to the entire data
using a URL and/or the local file name. Furthermore, if the user wants to
work only with a small part of the data set, a constraint expression can
be supplied along with the URL to save on network data transmission time.

You can obtain a copy of the latest version of cdf-dods software from

SETTING UP A DATA SERVER

Note: this discussion assumes that Apache World Wide Web server is
installed on the workstation which is to be used to serve data. You do not
need to use this particular web server, any server that supports CGI 1.1
(Netscape, Apache, CERN, ...) will work. If you do not have a web server
installed, first install one and then continue installing the DODS server.
For information on various servers, see: 

NCSA		http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/
Apache		http://www.apache.org/
CERN/W3C	http://www.w3c.org/

To set up a DODS data server using the CDF server implementation, first
follow the instructions in the INSTALL document. Four programs comprise the
data server: a CGI (nph-dods) which is used to dispatch each data request to
the correct filter program, and three filter programs (cdf_das, cdf_dds,
cdf_dods). Really there is only one program, cdf_dods, with links from
cdf_das and cdf_dds to cdf_dods. Make sure that the CGI module `nph-dods'
is somewhere where the http server can run CGI modules.

Files that are to be served by the DODS server must either be within the http
server's document root directory or they must be accessible from the document
root directory using links. To find out which directory is the http server's
document root, look in the httpd configuration file.

For example, to make the file example.cdf available to users, it must be
either placed or linked within the document root directory. On my
workstation the document root directory is /usr/local/apache/htdocs so the
file must be moved or copied to that directory or one of its subdirectories
or I must create a symbolic link in that directory or one of its
subdirectories to the files. I have created a directory `data/cdf' in the
http server's document root directory and copied the file example.cdf. The
URL to that data file is:

	http://twilek.hao.ucar.edu/cgi-bin/nph-dods/data/cdf/example.cdf

Note that after the machine name (twilek.hao.ucar.edu) the URL contains the
path to the DODS data server CGI and that the path to the data (relative to
the document root directory) *follows* the CGI name.

Also note that to limit access to the server to a specific set of machines,
place the CGI within the document root directory (this works for NCSA version
1.5 and later and also for Apache 1.1.1 and later). See the file SECURITY for
a detailed description of the types of security DODS provides for data and
how to install servers to take advantage of those features.

For more examples see the test files in the tests subdirectory.         

Good Luck :-)
