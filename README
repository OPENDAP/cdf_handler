This file describes the modifcations made during the creation of the
CDF objects created to make a CDF server. 

CDF support an EPOCH type.  This is a long (or maybe double) that
captures date and time.  


CDF has one set of dimensions for all of the variables in the file.
It uses a variance flag to reduce the data storge requirement for
repetative data.  The variance flag was eliminated in the server
and all variables in a single CDF were passed to DODS with the
same dimensions.
